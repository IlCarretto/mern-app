<h1>FULLSTACK MERN APP SOCIAL NETWORK</h1>

<h2>FRONTEND made with REACT, ReduxToolkit, Typescript, Material UI, react-router-dom, custom useTheme, etc.</h2>
<h2>BACKEND made with NodeJS, Express, mongoose, MongoDB, helmet, dotenv, etc.</h2>

<h3>Includes API calls linked to BE, AUTHORIZATION, state management, PERSIST STORE, switch light/dark mode, and much more!</h3>

<p>This was a really challenging project, and a huge step up to my typescript game; also, building the server with nodeJS made me understand more of what happens under the hood.</p>
<p>Inspired by this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8YELRmUb5o&ab_channel=EdRoh; I was able to complete the exercise but not only this, I decided to implement more functionalities such as:
- option to SHARE people's posts, with counter of how many times the post has been shared.
- working searchbar to see people's Profile Page.
- on your Profile you are only able to see your posts, or the posts you have shared.
- chance of DELETING your posts.
- posts on your timeline in chronological order.</p>
